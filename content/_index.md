# About

<!-- under the supervision of [Ir. Ts. Gs. Dr. Chow Ming Fai](https://www.monash.edu.my/engineering/about-us/all-staff/civil-engineering/ap-dr-chow-ming-fai) -->

I'm a Research Assistant at [Monash University Malaysia](https://www.monash.edu.my). I obtained my BSc. in Applied Mathematics from [Tunku Abdul Rahman University (UTAR)](https://www.utar.edu.my). My research is motivated by the reinforcement learning advancements in attention-based predictive models. I believe that soon the current LLM would reach a point where it hardly improves, and the next gap to filled in is experience.

Beyond academics, I'm currently working on several web development projects, and actively providing college-level mathematics and public speaking tutoring services.
