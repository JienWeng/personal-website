# About

I'm a seasonal hackathon participant and a math nerd. I obtained my BSc. in Applied Mathematics from [Tunku Abdul Rahman University (UTAR)](https://www.utar.edu.my). Soon, I'll be pursuing my postgraduate studies in Mathematics, where my work primarily builds upon artificial intelligence within reinforcement learning frameworks. I believe that soon the current LLM would reach a point where it hardly improves, and the next gap to filled in is experience.

Beyond academics, I'm currently working on several web development projects, and actively providing college-level mathematics and public speaking tutoring services.
