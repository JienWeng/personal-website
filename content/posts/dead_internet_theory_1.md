Lately, I’ve been noticing a growing number of AI-generated content, especially on both Reddit and LinkedIn. Not all, but now speaking from the perspective of a student, I found out some of my peers are posting regarding their achievements with some very fancy emojis, and when you see and you can definitely tell that’s AI-generated content. I start doubting how many percentage of the posts are actually really happening because there is a high probability that a bunch of them are just generated by AI that’s actually never happened.

I do admit I used ChatGPT for my content in the past, but I realised that the content is not really what I’ve done before, the experience is basically “artificial”. I don’t deny AI as a productivity tool, but sometimes you just can’t tell the existence of the content written there. There’s a coldness, an emptiness that creeps in when scrolling through these posts, making it feel like shouting into a void where no real person listens. 

It is really different nowadays to scroll through social media, LinkedIn, and Reddit. You don’t feel people there. It makes me really feel like the dead Internet Theory is here, and everything is full of bot activity and automatically generated content manipulated by algorithms. The authenticity of online interactions seems to be fading, they replaced by automated perfection that feels disturbingly hollow.

Chatbots or AI are really good for proofreading, but they are still only good at proofreading. Soon I think they will no longer have real content or real ideas when people are writing their experiences, their ideas; they just become full of BS nowadays. Now I even wish to find some long-ass article that is awfully organised, I find some fun to read through even though it was not good, but I can find authenticity there. 

Has anyone noticed this? You could share them with me or offer me a perspective I haven’t considered before. I’d be more than happy to discuss it. I think we’ll might have another follow-up episode on this.
