The current body of literature on the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Malaysia mainly focuses on 2 aspects:

1. The assessment of the baseline efficeincy and pollution control of exisitng Malaysia's infrastructure.

2. Exploration of advanced technological interventions to meet future sustainbility goals.

# Cuurent Trends of WWTPs Studies in Malaysia

Several recent studies focuses on evaluating the efficacy of WWTPs against specific pollutants, such as nutrients and emerging contaminants. Research indicates that while centralized plants in Kuching are effective against conventional pollutants, they face challenges with emerging contaminats like pharmaceuticals and microplastics {% cite(path="bibliography/renewable_energy.bib") %}Kuok2022{% end %}. This is supported by a comprehensive screenings in Malaysian wastewater, which highlight the environmental hazards posed by pharmaceutical residues and active {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Sapkota2025{% end %}.

Epidemiological approach based on wastewater have been applied in both Penang and Sungai Petaini to assess the amount of heavy metals concentrations, serving as a proxy for public health monitoring {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Ruzi2023a{% end %} {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Ruzi2024{% end %}. Furthermore, studies in specific industrail sectors, such as batik industry require integrated physical-biological treatment systems to manage complex wastewaters effluents had also been examined {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Daud2022{% end %}.

In terms of operational efficiency, studies involving Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) have been used to benchmark the eco-environmental efficeincy of sewage treatment plants across Malaysia. Findings suggest that there are gaps in resoruce utilization and energy consumption for different sizes of WWTPs, suggesting the potential for cost-savings and environmental beneftis through optimization {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Fallahiarezoudar2022{% end %}. Additionally, similar studies of reliability assessments in suspended growth systems in Melaka also points out the need for consistent process monitoring to improve the overall operational efficiency {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Ishak2022{% end %}.

# Technological Interventions

There is a clear methodological trend in the literature from physical modelling to the adoption of dynamic, data-driven approaches for WWTPs in Malaysia. Several studies have explored the use of machine learning techniques, such as Reccurent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict key performance indicators, such as effluent quality and detection of time-delay water quality indicators of WWTPs {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Wongburi2023{% end %} {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Zhang2023a{% end %}. In Malaysia, a growing amount of machine learning studies have been conducted in the context of WWTPs in local settings {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Ansari2018{% end %} {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Rahmat2023{% end %} {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Rahmat2022{% end %}.

On global scale, machine learning is also increasingly used ot model nitrous oxide ($N_2 O$) emissions and several other greenhouse gases from WWTPs {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Khalil2023{% end %}. Intelligent prediction modls are now seen as essential for developing precise mitigation strategies to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases from WWTPs, as well as optimization on energy utilization {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Zhang2025a{% end %} {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Peng2025{% end %}. To the best of my knowledge, there is no such study in greenhouse gases prediction in Malaysia yet. Given the increasing focus on sustainability and climate change mitigation, this represents a significant research gap that needs to be addressed.

Across the reviewed literature, there is a clear trends of move away from reactive management towards proactive and predictive strategies. Whether through Deep Learning for influent quality {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Zhang2023a{% end %} or data assimilation techniques for ammonium nitrogen prediction {% cite(path="bibliography/wwtp_review.bib") %}Bertret2025{% end %}, researchers agree that the historical data must be effectively incorporated to anticipate the operational performance of WWTPs.
